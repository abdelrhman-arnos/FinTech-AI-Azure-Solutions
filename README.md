# FinTech AI Azure Solutions
Demonstrate practical solutions for various FinTech challenges using Azure services and AI components. Each standalone project addresses a specific problem (e.g., fraud detection, risk assessment, payment optimization) while an overarching integration directory shows how these pieces can be combined into a comprehensive solution.

## Key Focus Areas:
FinTech Domain Expertise: Solve real-world FinTech challenges.
Azure Cloud: Utilize Azure AI, Functions, Cognitive Services, Machine Learning, and other cloud services.
AI Components: Implement predictive analytics, NLP, anomaly detection, and more.
Modularity: Enable both isolated development and integrated solution building.

## Repository Structure
The repository is organized in a modular fashion with separate directories for individual projects and common resources:
```

### Directory Explanations:
Root Files:
- README.md: Project overview, goals, and instructions for contributors.
- CONTRIBUTING.md: Guidelines for code style, issue tracking, pull requests, and branching strategy.
- LICENSE: Choose an appropriate open-source license.
docs/:
- architecture.md: A high-level document describing the overall system design, integration strategy, and how individual projects fit together.
projects/:
- Each sub-directory is dedicated to a FinTech problem with its own README, source code, Azure deployment scripts, and supplementary documentation.
integrated-solution/:
- A directory that demonstrates how multiple sub-projects can be orchestrated into a larger, cohesive solution. This can include API gateways, microservice orchestration, or data aggregation layers.

## Technical Considerations
### Azure Integration
- Service Use: Leverage Azure Functions, Azure Cognitive Services, and Azure Machine Learning. For example, use Cognitive Services for fraud detection (image/NLP analysis on transactions) or Machine Learning for risk prediction.
- Infrastructure as Code: Use ARM templates or Terraform scripts (found in the azure/ folders) to set up environments, ensuring reproducible deployments.
- CI/CD: Set up GitHub Actions or Azure DevOps pipelines for automated testing, build, and deployment. Each project should have its own pipeline, as well as a pipeline for the integrated solution.

### AI Components
- Model Management: Include notebooks, model training scripts, and evaluation metrics in each project where applicable.
- Data Handling: Consider using Azure Databricks or Azure Synapse for data processing if the projects involve heavy data analytics.

### Coding & Documentation
- Modular Code: Write clear, modular code with proper documentation, including in-code comments and markdown docs.
- Best Practices: Follow industry standards for naming conventions, error handling, and testing.

## Project Management
- Contribution Guidelines: Please refer to the CONTRIBUTING.md file for detailed guidelines on contributing, code style, issue reporting, and pull requests.
- Issues & Milestones: Use GitHub Issues to track individual FinTech challenges, and milestones for major integration steps.

## Roadmap
1. Initial Setup: Define FinTech challenges, create initial repository structure, and develop the first standalone project (e.g., fraud detection).
2. Additional Projects: Develop further projects such as risk assessment and payment optimization, each with complete documentation and CI/CD pipelines.
3. Integration Phase: Create the integrated solution directory, develop orchestration scripts or APIs, and conduct end-to-end testing.
4. Future Enhancements: Incorporate community feedback, further optimize solutions, and align project milestones with Azure certification objectives.

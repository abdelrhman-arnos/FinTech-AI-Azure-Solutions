# Fraud Detection Module

## Overview

This module provides a solution to detect fraudulent activities in financial transactions. By leveraging Azure AI, machine learning models, and Python, the module analyzes transactional data to identify patterns indicative of fraud.

## Problem Statement

Financial institutions face significant losses due to fraudulent transactions. This project aims to reduce these losses by detecting anomalies in real time and flagging suspicious activities.

## Objectives

- Develop a machine learning model to detect potential fraud.
- Utilize Azure Cognitive Services and Functions for scalable processing.
- Provide real-time alerts and detailed reporting on detected anomalies.

## Technical Stack

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Machine Learning Libraries:** scikit-learn, TensorFlow/PyTorch
- **Azure Services:** Azure Functions, Cognitive Services, Azure Machine Learning
- **Data Processing:** Pandas, NumPy

## Architecture

The solution consists of:

1. **Data Ingestion:** Collecting and preprocessing transaction data.
2. **Model Training:** Building and evaluating fraud detection models.
3. **Real-time Inference:** Deploying the model as an Azure Function for live data analysis.
4. **Alerting:** Integrating with Azure Notification Hubs for real-time alerts.

## Setup & Installation

1. Clone the repository.
2. Set up a Python virtual environment.
3. Install dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
4. Configure Azure services using the provided ARM templates in the `azure/` directory.
5. Run the training and inference scripts as described in the documentation.

## Usage

- **Training:** `python src/train_model.py`
- **Inference:** Deploy the function using the Azure CLI and monitor alerts.

# Risk Assessment Module

## Overview

The Risk Assessment module is designed to evaluate the credit risk and financial exposure of clients. Using advanced machine learning techniques and Azure cloud services, this module aims to provide accurate risk scores to aid in decision-making.

## Problem Statement

Financial institutions need to assess the risk associated with lending and credit decisions. This module focuses on developing predictive models to evaluate risk, ensuring that the institution can make informed decisions while minimizing potential losses.

## Objectives

- Build and deploy a risk scoring model.
- Integrate data from various sources for comprehensive risk evaluation.
- Provide actionable insights through real-time risk assessments.

## Technical Stack

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Machine Learning Libraries:** scikit-learn, XGBoost, LightGBM
- **Azure Services:** Azure Machine Learning, Azure Functions
- **Data Handling:** Pandas, SQLAlchemy

## Architecture

The module is structured as follows:

1. **Data Collection & Preprocessing:**  
   Aggregates and cleans data from internal and external sources.
2. **Model Development:**  
   Trains a predictive model using historical data.
3. **Deployment:**  
   Deploys the model via Azure Functions for real-time scoring.
4. **Reporting:**  
   Generates dashboards for risk monitoring and analysis.

## Setup & Installation

1. Clone the repository.
2. Create a Python virtual environment and install dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Use the ARM templates in the `azure/` directory to set up Azure Machine Learning workspace and related services.
4. Run the model training script with `python src/train_risk_model.py`.

## Usage

- **Training:** `python src/train_risk_model.py`
- **Real-time Scoring:** Deploy the function using Azure CLI and monitor the outputs via the provided dashboards.

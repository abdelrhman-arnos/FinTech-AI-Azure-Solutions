# System Architecture Overview

## Introduction

This document outlines the overall system design for the FinTech AI Azure Solutions repository. The architecture is designed to be modular, scalable, and maintainable, leveraging Azure cloud services and AI capabilities to solve complex FinTech challenges.

## Architectural Principles

- **Modularity:** Each FinTech problem is addressed as an independent module, which can operate on its own or be integrated into a larger solution.
- **Scalability:** Azure services such as Functions, Cognitive Services, and Machine Learning ensure that each module can scale to meet demand.
- **Interoperability:** Standardized interfaces and APIs allow seamless integration between modules.
- **Resilience:** The architecture is built to handle failures gracefully, ensuring high availability and reliability.

## High-Level Components

1. **Data Layer:**

   - Azure Databricks/Azure Synapse for data processing and analytics.
   - Data storage using Azure Blob Storage or SQL Databases.

2. **Application Layer:**

   - Individual project modules (e.g., fraud detection, risk assessment) developed in Python.
   - Shared libraries and services for common functionalities.

3. **Integration Layer:**

   - An orchestration layer in the `integrated-solution` directory that brings together the functionalities of all modules.
   - API Gateways and service meshes for communication between modules.

4. **Presentation Layer:**
   - Dashboards and reporting tools (e.g., Power BI) for visualization.
   - Real-time monitoring using Azure Monitor.

## Data Flow Diagram

_(Insert or link to a diagram if available)_

- Data is ingested from multiple sources.
- Preprocessing is handled by dedicated services.
- Each module processes the data independently.
- Results are aggregated in the integrated solution for comprehensive reporting.

## Security Considerations

- Authentication and authorization using Azure Active Directory.
- Data encryption in transit and at rest.
- Regular security audits and compliance checks.

## Deployment & CI/CD

- Infrastructure as Code (ARM templates/Terraform scripts) are used for provisioning.
- Automated CI/CD pipelines via GitHub Actions or Azure DevOps ensure continuous integration and deployment.

## Conclusion

This architecture ensures that each component of the FinTech solutions is scalable, secure, and easy to maintain, providing a robust framework for addressing various financial challenges.

# Integrated FinTech Solution

## Overview

This directory demonstrates how to integrate individual FinTech modules (such as fraud detection and risk assessment) into a cohesive, end-to-end solution. The integrated solution provides a unified interface for data processing, analytics, and reporting across multiple FinTech challenges.

## Objectives

- Orchestrate multiple FinTech modules into a single solution.
- Ensure seamless data flow and communication between modules.
- Provide comprehensive dashboards and reporting for a holistic view of the financial ecosystem.

## Architecture

The integrated solution consists of:

1. **Aggregation Layer:**  
   Collects data from various modules.
2. **Orchestration Engine:**  
   Manages the workflow between modules, ensuring data is processed in sequence and combined effectively.
3. **API Gateway:**  
   Provides a unified API endpoint for external applications.
4. **Monitoring & Reporting:**  
   Centralized dashboards to monitor system performance and output metrics from each module.

## Setup & Installation

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the `integrated-solution` directory.
2. Set up a Python virtual environment and install dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Deploy shared Azure resources using the ARM templates in the `azure/` folder.
4. Configure environment variables and API endpoints as per the provided documentation.
5. Start the orchestration scripts with `python src/run_integration.py`.

## Usage

- **Start Integration:** Run `python src/run_integration.py` to initiate the data flow across modules.
- **Monitoring:** Access the integrated dashboards via the configured API gateway or Power BI.
